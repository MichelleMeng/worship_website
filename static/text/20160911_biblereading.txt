Romans 13:8-10<br/><br/>

Luke 10:25-37<br/>
25On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?" <br/>
26"What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?" <br/>
27He answered: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" <br/>
28"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live." <br/>
29But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" <br/>
30In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. 31A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 32So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33But a Samaritan, as he travelled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. 34He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. 35The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.' 
36"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?" <br/>
37The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." <br/>
Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."<br/>
